        "Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a relatively novel technique in which a model learns from unlabeled data, and is often used when the data is corrupted or if there is very little of it. A practical use for SSL is to create intermediate embeddings that are learned from the data. These embeddings are based on the dataset itself, with similar images having similar embeddings, and vice versa. They are then attached to the rest of the model, which uses those embeddings as information and effectively learns and makes predictions properly. These embeddings, ideally, should contain as much information and insight about the data as possible, so that the model can make better predictions. However, a common problem that arises is that the model creates embeddings that are redundant. For example, if two images are similar, the model will create embeddings that are just a string of 1's, or some other value that contains repeating bits of information. This is no better than a one-hot encoding or just having one bit as the model’s representations; it defeats the purpose of the embeddings, as they do not learn as much about the dataset as possible. For other approaches, the solution to the problem was to carefully configure the model such that it tries not to be redundant.\n",
        "\n",
        "Barlow Twins is a new approach to this problem; while other solutions mainly tackle the first goal of invariance (similar images have similar embeddings), the Barlow Twins method also prioritizes the goal of reducing redundancy.\n",
        "\n",
        "It also has the advantage of being much simpler than other methods, and its model architecture is symmetric, meaning that both twins in the model do the same thing. It is also near state-of-the-art on imagenet, even exceeding methods like SimCLR.\n",
        "\n",
        "One disadvantage of Barlow Twins is that it is heavily dependent on augmentation, suffering major performance decreases in accuracy without them.\n",
        "\n",
        "TL, DR: Barlow twins creates representations that are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Invariant.\n",
        "Not redundant, and carry as much info about the dataset.\n",
        "Also, it is simpler than other methods.\n",
